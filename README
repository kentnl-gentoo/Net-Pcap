NAME

    Net-Pcap - Interface to pcap(3) LBL packet capture library


DESCRIPTION

    The Net::Pcap module is a Perl binding to the LBL pcap(3) packet 
    capture library.

    The latest source code for the Pcap library can be found at 
    <http://www.tcpdump.org/>.  The source code and binary for the 
    Win32 port can be found at <http://www.winpcap.org/>.


INSTALLATION

    If your pcap header files are installed somewhere strange, create 
    the Makefile using the INC and/or LIBS option.

        $ perl Makefile.PL INC=-I/usr/local/include/pcap \
            LIBS='-L/usr/lib/pcap -lpcap'

    Then compile the extension as per usual:

        $ make
        $ make test
        $ make install

    To install the extension in a private directory, you can use the
    PREFIX option when creating Makefile.PL.

    An ANSI-compliant compiler is required to compile the extension. 
    For most of the tests, an administrative account is required 
    since opening a network interface in promiscuous mode is a 
    privileged operation.  Some tests also require a working network 
    interface with traffic on it otherwise the tests will appear to 
    hang.  You can generate traffic by pinging a non existing IP 
    address on your network segment.  Consult the source for individual 
    tests for more information.

    Net::Pcap is compatible with all the versions of the Pcap library, 
    including the old BSD ones and the Windows port WinPcap.

    Net::Pcap should work on any Perl since 5.004_05. This module has 
    been tested by the author on the following Perl and system versions
    but is likely to run on many more:

HISTORY

    The original version of Net::Pcap, version 0.01, was written by 
    Peter Lister <p.lister@cranfield.ac.uk> using SWIG.

    Version 0.02 was created by Bo Adler <thumper@alumni.caltech.edu> 
    with a few bugfixes but not uploaded to CPAN.  It can be found at:
        http://www.buttsoft.com/~thumper/software/perl/Net-Pcap/

    Versions 0.03 and 0.04 were created by Tim Potter (TIMPOTTER) who 
    entirely rewrote Net::Pcap using XS and wrote the documentation, 
    with the help of David N. Blank-Edelman <dnb@ccs.neu.edu> for 
    testing and general polishing.

    Version 0.05 was released by Marco Carnut (KCARNUT) with fixes 
    to make it work with Cygwin and WinPcap. 

    Version 0.04.02 was independantly created by Jean-Louis Morel 
    (JLMOREL) but not uploaded on the CPAN. It can be found here: 
        http://www.bribes.org/perl/wnetpcap.html
    Based on Tim Potter's version 0.04, it included fixes for WinPcap
    and added wrappers for several new libpcap functions as well as 
    WinPcap specific functions.
